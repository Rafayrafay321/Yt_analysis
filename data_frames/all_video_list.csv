In this video I'm going to talk about everything concerning AI as it pertains to Analytics. The good, the bad, and where I think it will be in 5+ years. 

I understand this is a sensitive topic and not everyone is going to agree with my viewpoint, but hopefully this will open up a discussion around these things where we can dive into it more as a community.

It can be difficult to know exactly what to say to the hundreds of questions you might be asked in an interview. Practice and preparation are the best way to make sure you can nail those questions.

UC7cs8q-gJRlGwj4A8OmCmXg,sua7xKN0cPc,SQL Interview Questions and Answers for Beginners | Data Analyst Interview Questions,2020-05-13T15:00:26Z,"Take my Full MySQL Course Here: https://bit.ly/3tqOipr

Today we look at some SQL Interview Questions. The first questions we look at are Phone interview questions which are generally more broad questions. Then we look at In-Person interview questions which are typically more technical and specific. 

You may get some technical questions during your interview or none at all! It all depends on the position and the people interviewing. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but are ones that I have personally been asked or I have heard have been asked from other colleagues and redditors.

I hope these really do help you try to see what kind of questions you may be asked and what things you may need to prepare for to be ready for your next interview!

I don't want new people out of college or changing careers to have unrealistic expectations when trying to become a Data Analyst. It's hard enough to get an entry level job, but if you have the expectation that 84k starting is normal then you are going to be very disappointed. If you agree like the comment I left below and if you disagree comment on my comment below!
